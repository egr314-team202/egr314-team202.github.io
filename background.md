## Introduction

Bathrooms regularly have high levels of humidity and are disposed to different temperatures throughout the day given the amount of water from faucets, toilets, and baths/showers that they use. For example, toilets on average use between 1.6-7 gallons of water per flush, which amounts to a possible 12,775 gallons of water per year. Similarly, on average, showers in the United States use more than 1 trillion gallons of water per year. That is the equivalent of about 40 million swimming pools. That is a lot of water and with all that water and changes in temperature comes high levels of humidity which can lead to a buildup of black mold, which can have harmful side effects including respiratory problems and allergic reactions. One of the main reasons for the buildup of black mold is poor ventilation in bathrooms that result in a perfect humid and moist environment that allows black mold to thrive.
