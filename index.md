Humidity and Temperature Sensing Project

EGR 314: Embedded Systems Design 2 - Spring 2023

Team 202: Carlos Chacon, Miguel Chacon, Wyatte Ricks, Lukas Severinghaus

Professor Daniel Aukes

January 23, 2023

 
## Introduction

Bathrooms regularly have high levels of humidity and are disposed to different temperatures throughout the day as a result from the water used by faucets, toilets, and baths/showers. For example, toilets on average use between 1.6-7 gallons of water per flush, which amounts to a possible 12,775 gallons of water per year. Similarly, on average, showers in the United States use more than 1 trillion gallons of water per year. That is the equivalent of about 40 million swimming pools. That is a lot of water and with all that water and changes in temperature comes high levels of humidity which can lead to a buildup of black mold, which can have harmful side effects including respiratory problems and allergic reactions. One of the main reasons for the buildup of black mold is poor ventilation in bathrooms that result in a perfect humid and moist environment that allows black mold to thrive.

## Team Organization

After meeting together and discussing each team member's individual goals and outcomes for the course, the team compiled a list combining the top 5 overarching goals:

1. Improve individual skills and understanding of embedded systems
2. Create a design that is visually appealing
3. Develop a design that is practical and meets user needs
4. Focus on intuitive, human-centric interfaces
5. Promote a collaborative and supportive team environment

_Team Charter_

As a result of the collective team goals and outcomes listed above, Team 202’s charter is: to collaborate and support one another in the development and creation of a visually appealing design that implements the team’s skills and knowledge of embedded systems, conforms to user needs, and incorporates an intuitive, human centric interface in order to produce a successful project with a practical application. 

_Mission Statement_

This team’s mission is to design and build a switch retrofit device that uses environmental sensing and embedded systems to provide an economic and health solution to solve the accumulation of moisture in confined spaces.

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Product Requirements

In order to develop the requirements for the product, the team first analyzed the market for current solutions to the problem of accumulating moisture in confined spaces.

## Design Ideation

Before continuing with the design process, the team took some time to brainstorm design concepts on a Jamboard. Each sticky note represented a way to execute a particular aspect of the design like a sensing method or actuation device as seen in **Figure 1**. These concepts were then sorted down into several categories and distilled into three design concepts as seen in **Figure 2** and **Figure 3**. The concepts represented three unique ways to approach the user needs; each with a different combination of technical aspects and specific feature implementations. Finally, to best communicate these concepts, the team developed visual representations of them. These depictions will be used further on in the design process to gather feedback and inform future design decisions.

## Design Concepts

After the team generated the three distinct design concepts to approach the user needs, it was time to move onto the next step and create visual designs of the concepts in order to better understand how each device would function. This will be crucial as it will allow the team to make more thoughtful and practical decisions regarding which concept to choose and work on. 

The three design concepts are as follows: a multipurpose smart switch (**Figure 4**), practical switch (**Figure 5**), and energy conserver switch (**Figure 6**). Furthermore, each design concept includes arrows pointing to the concept ideas that were grouped with the design.
