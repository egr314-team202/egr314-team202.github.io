# EGR314 Team 202: Humidity and Temperature Sensing Project Website
**Team members:** Carlos Chacon, Miguel Chacon, Wyatte Ricks, Lukas Severinghaus

**Last Updated:** January 21, 2023

Welcome to the project website for Team 202! This project was undertaken as part of EGR 314, Embedded Systems Design 2, in the Spring 2023 semester, taught by Dr. Daniel Aukes, at Arizona State University on the Polytechnic Campus.

 
## Introduction
Bathrooms regularly have high levels of humidity and are exposed to different temperatures throughout the day as a result of the water used by faucets, toilets, and baths/showers. High levels of humidity can lead to a buildup of black mold, which can have harmful side effects including respiratory problems and allergic reactions. One of the main reasons for the buildup of mold is poor ventilation in bathrooms that results in a humid and moist environment, perfect mold breeding ground. At certain temperatures, this humidity can condense into liquid water, coating walls, ceilings, and other surfaces with a fine layer of water, further promoting mold growth. 

To combat this, bathrooms commonly have ventilation fans to suck out moisture. However, these fans are noisy, and are commonly activated by a switch, which requires a user to manually turn it on or off. Newer houses may incorporate a timer or automatic switch control, but for many home occupants, retrofitting existing fixtures is not a possibility, due to rental restrictions, or lack of expertise. This leads to users neglecting to use the fans, promoting mold growth, or forgetting to turn them off, causing excess energy wastage. 

Our team is looking to tackle this by developing an automated switch control that can retrofit over an existing switch without any modifications to the switch or electrical wiring. This enables automated control of the fan, both at high humidity levels, and when requested by the user, for a time interval. By combining this with Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity through MQTT, this device can also integrate into a broader network of home automation devices.

## Project Status
As of January, 2023, this project is still underway. We will be presenting the final concept at Innovation Showcase on April 28, 2023. Until then, we will continue to push regular updates to this website and it's associated repositories as the project progresses.
