# Lessons Learned
After reflecting on the semester, the team noticed that there were a lot of lessoned learned while working on this project. Additionally, some lessons were learned from the previous iteration of this course that were then implemented into this semester in order to develop a successful product within the given time restraints. This section lists 10 of the most important lessons learned by the team over the course of this semester and implemented from the previous semester. 

## Lesson 1
Keep up with the deadlines. The deadlines are set because they are the optimal times to have finished a task or assignment. Even when a deadline is pushed back, try your best to get that task or assignment finished by that deadline because the time spent past that deadline will be much needed later in the project. For example, having adequate time to complete all of the software debugging is extremely important. 

## Lesson 2
Order your parts and components as soon as possible and make sure that you order many. This was a lesson learned from last semester and implemented in this one. Not having your components can set you back a lot of time, especially because you need them to complete your boards. The sooner you have them, the easier it will be identify problems and to fix them. Ordering multiple components is important in case they break or get lost, and because you will be making multiple boards.    

## Lesson 3
In this course, having good teammates is crucial for success. Make sure to pick teammate that you have good chemistry with, as it will make the project more enjoyable, but also make sure that they are competent, have shared work hours, and have a good learning and professional characteristics. This includes having a good work ethic and having good communication skills.

## Lesson 4
Use the resources available to you for help. There are so many great resources available to help you succeed in this class. If the team had trouble with a concept and process, it would not hesitate to reach out to Professor Aukes, the Teaching Team, the discussion board, other groups and students, and the class website. The website was especially helpful for the team when learning how to use Cadence. Also, making sure that the team's project and exceptions  were clearly communicated to the professor and provided in writing. For example, the team had to make sure to get the correct approval to incorporate a servo motor into the project.

## Lesson 5
Make clear objectives for each assignment. The team would split each task amongst each other in order to simplify the tasks. Making sure everyone knew what they were supposed to be working on gave everyone a sense of purpose on the team, which helped moral but also made each assignment easier in the end.
