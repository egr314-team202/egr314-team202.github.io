## Recommendations For Future Students
The first step into class is always nerveracking. You do not know what is gonna happen, if you will have a successful semester, or even if you will have a good group. EGR314 Team 202 hopes this list of recommendations will provide some helpful tips so that you can have a successful semester. 

## Tip 1
When you walk into class on that first day, do not just sit down and hope for the best. Make sure to stand up and walk around, meet people, and see who you think you can work well with. Form a group that you feel comfortable working with and make sure they are all on the same page in terms of commitment to the course and wanting to get the most out of it. 

## Tip 2
Just because there is an assignment due later does not mean you should not take the time to get it done early. A lot of the problems that arise from an incomplete product are due to delayed shipping, incorrect parts, and or late JLC PCB fabrication. These are a major time killer that you could have spent time on other parts of the project such as software and end design. Be ahead of the game and you will succeed.

## Tip 3
When you are searching for parts and are having a hard time knowing what to choose. Get the part with the most information on its datasheet, try to have all your components with the same type of serial communication, and always check the package size of the part. A good datasheet will provide all the necessary information needed to get the part functioning. I2C components are misleading and can seem more complicated than SPI but in the long run provide accessability for a more compact design and easier use. As for package size make sure its a hand solderable part or you have the equipment available to solder the tiny packages properly. We recommend 0805 sized components. Also learn to use solder paste. It will be your best friend when surface mount soldering components to your board. 

## Tip 4
When programming a component, invest time and or money into a logic analyzer. Using this program on an oscilloscope or even separate device can help with debugging addresses for every serial component found on your board. You'll get an address, but then you will need to understand how to package the bytes of information to get what you are looking for, and the datasheet should include all of that. 

## Tip 5
Always ask questions because sometimes the assignment given has not been updated or has more requirements than listed. Always communicate with the teaching team and with other students. If someone has something functioning do not just ask for what they did, ask for how they did it so that you understand what do and can learn from them. Everyone is under the same pressure and understands the struggle so do not be afraid to ask for help.
