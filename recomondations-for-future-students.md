## Recomondations For Future Students
The first step into class is always nerveracking. You don't know what is gonna happen, if you'll have a successful semester, or even if you'll have a good group. Team 202 from EGR 314 hope this will find you then, because we want to provide some helpful tips so you can have a great semester. 

## Tip 1
When you  walk into class on that first day, don't just sit down and hope for the best. Stand up and walk around, meet people see who you think you can work with and will provide timely and good work. Form a group that you can feel comfortable with and easy to be with. Find someone who is there to be successful. 

## Tip 2
Just because there is an assignment due later doesn't mean you should not take the time to get it done early. A lot of the problems that arise from an uncompleted product are delaid shipping, incorrect parts, and or late JLC PCB fabrication. These are a major killer to time you can spend on software and design. Be ahead of the game and you will succeed.

## Tip 3
When you are searching for parts and are having a hard time knowing what to choose. Get the part with the most information on its datasheet, stick with I2C components, and always check the package size of the part. A datasheet will prove to provide well needed information that can be a big part of why you got it functioning. I2C components are misleading and can seem more than SPI but in the long run provide accessability for a more compact design and easier to use. As for package size make sure its a hand solderable part or you have the equipment available to solder the tiny packages properly. 

## Tip 4
When programming a component invest time and or money into a logic analyzer. Using this program on an oscilloscope or even separate device can help with debugging addresses for every serial component found on your board. Sometimes the address found on the datasheet is the right address but needs to be shifted 2 bytes. 

## Tip 5
Always ask questions because sometimes the assignment given hasn't been updated or ahs more requirements than listed. Always be talking with the teaching team and with other students. If someone has something functioning don't just ask for what they did, ask for how they did it so that can be used later on with your components. Everyone is under the same pressure and understands the struggle
