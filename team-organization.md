# Team Organization

After meeting together and discussing each team member's individual goals and outcomes for the course, the team compiled a list combining the top 5 overarching goals:

1. Improve individual skills and understanding of embedded systems
2. Create a design that is visually appealing
3. Develop a design that is practical and meets user needs
4. Focus on intuitive, human-centric interfaces
5. Promote a collaborative and supportive team environment

## Team Charter

As a result of the collective team goals and outcomes listed above, Team 202’s charter is: to collaborate and support one another in the development and creation of a visually appealing design that implements the team’s skills and knowledge of embedded systems, conforms to user needs, and incorporates an intuitive, human centric interface in order to produce a successful project with a practical application. 

## Mission Statement

This team’s mission is to design and build a switch retrofit device that uses environmental sensing and embedded systems to provide an economic and health solution to solve the accumulation of moisture in confined spaces.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to produce systems that respond to the environment using
serial sensing and actuation. The team must broadcast their environmental data to the internet over WiFi using the MQTT
protocol and the system implemented must detect at least 2 of the following environmental conditions by applying at least 2 different serial sensors:

● temperature <br>
● humidity <br>
● atmospheric pressure <br>
● wind speed <br>

Furthermore, at least one motor controlled by a motor controller
communicating over the I2C or SPI-based protocol.

## Project Focus

Given the wide variety of options and opportunities available with this project, the team narrowed the scope by having each individual team member develop an idea, concept, or problem that they wanted to solve. Each member then presented their findings and the team then voted on the one that they would like to work on for this project. Voting was focused around the idea that was most representative of a user-centered project that reflected the team's mission statement and the project's description. After undergoing this process, the team decided to focus on developing a solution that would provide a sustainable option for people in need of climate control within their own homes. The remainder of this report will detail the steps taken by the team in order to produce an effective and successful solution that adheres to the team's mission statement and to the project description.
