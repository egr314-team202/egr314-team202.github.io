_**User Needs, Benchmarking, and Product Requirements**_

In order to develop the requirements for the product, the team first analyzed the market for current solutions to the problem of accumulating moisture in confined spaces. A majority of the solutions were smart switches that revolved around bathrooms and smart technologies affecting the ventilation and temperature setting systems. The different solutions were analyzed and their top positive and negative reviews were recorded and then evaluated for explicit or latnent user needs. These user needs would then be used for benchmarking the product. Below are the 5 products that were analyzed along side important information and the user needs that were extracted form the positive and negative reviews.

_**User Needs Evaluation**_

Having gone through different products and customer reviews that target the product statement, Team 202 generated a combined list of User Needs. This list consists of features and needs that customers liked, asked for, or complained about in the product reviews regarding the different multifunction switches above. The generated User Needs can be found below in Figure 1.



Figure 1 - Preliminary User Needs

The next step was to group the user needs into separate categories to develop overarching need statements. The groups can be found in the below Figure 2 and the overarching need statements are highlighted in yellow.

Figure 2 Organized User Needs

Once the User Needs were sectioned off into different categories as seen in Figure 2, each User Need was then ranked from Least Important to Most Important. This ranking can be found in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Ranked User Needs where: ⭐⭐⭐ - Most Important; ⭐⭐ - Important; ⭐ - Least Important
